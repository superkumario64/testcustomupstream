<div class="docs-heading">Standard Paragraph</div>

<p>This is a paragraph. Paragraphs are <a class="btn-link" href="javascript:void(0)">preset with a font size</a>, line height and spacing to match the overall vertical rhythm. To show what a paragraph looks like this needs a little more content so, did you know that there are storms occurring on Jupiter that are larger than the Earth? Pretty cool. Wrap strong around type to <strong>make it bold!</strong>. You can also use em to <em>italicize your words</em>.</p>

<div class="docs-heading">Lead Paragraph</div>

<p class="lead">What are your cats <em>really</em> dreaming about while they sleep?</p>
