REQUIREMENTS

No special requirements.


INSTALLATION
------------
Before you install the module it's advised to do a full synch of your
configuration otherwise all your config files will be listed by this module.
For more details see Full synchronisation part of this document.

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
   https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal-8/installing-drupal-8-modules
   for further information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
The module has no menu or modifiable settings. There is no configuration. When
enabled a 'Partial config' tab will appear on
admin/config/development/configuration page.


HOW TO USE
----------------
After enabling a 'Partial config' tab will appear on
admin/config/development/configuration page. Click on the Partial Export tab
and select the files you want to export to a tarball. In addition you can add
to the list the system.site.yml file which holds the UUID of your site.
After export you can copy the files from the tarball to your config/install
folder to apply those changes on next install.


FULL SYNCHRONISATION
--------------------
Steps to do a full synch:
 * Do a full export then an import. Your config files will be copied then to the
   staging directory (by default: sites/default/files/config_some-hash/staging).
 * Do a small modification in your settings. The files related with this
   modification will be listed on admin/config/development/configuration page.
 * Click "Import all" button. Be aware, all modifications you have done since
   last import will be lost!
